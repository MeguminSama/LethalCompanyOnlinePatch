# Lethal Company Online Patch

This was tested on v45, but probably works fine in other versions too.

1. Make sure you're using a modern version of PowerShell
   - You can get it here https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v7.4.0
2. Open the Lethal Company folder in file explorer.
   - Usually this is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company`
3. Place `patch.ps1` in the folder
4. Open your Start Menu and search "PowerShell 7". Open it.
5. Navigate to the game folder from inside powershell
   - This would usually be `cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company"`
   - Just change the path inside the quotes if your game is installed elsewhere.
6. Now run `.\patch.ps1`

The game should now be patched. If an error occurs, check the following:
- Are you not using a modern version of PowerShell? See the first instruction.
- If you open a github issue, make sure to include the console output, any errors, and the current game version.
- After you click "Online", does steam not say you're playing "Space War"? Try this:
  - Close Lethal Company
  - Press Win+R
  - Copy this: `steam://run/480`
  - If steam asks for you to install it, do so.
  - Then try running the game again.

# Getting the Steam Overlay working
- Open Steam
- Go to your Library
- In the bottom left, click "Add a Game"
- Click "Add a Non-Steam Game..."
- Click "Browse..."
- Navigate to the folder Lethal Company is in
- Add "Lethal Company.exe"
- Click "Add Selected Programs"
- Run Lethal Company from Steam

If the overlay still doesn't work...
- Right-click "Lethal Company" in the games list and select "Properties"
- In the "Shortcut" tab, make sure "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game" is checked.
  - If this is greyed out, the overlay should be working, and I can't help you any further.
